This is Vanilla javascript snake game with functional programming.

# index.js
Game starts from Line: 94
Used window.requestAnimationFrame(main) instead of setInterval because of performance issues.

gameEngine function is basically gameloop.
isCollide function will return boolean and it checks whether snake collide with itself or with wall
